Discrete element method
=======================
The discrete element method (or distinct element method) was initially formulated by \citet{Cundall:1979}. It simulates the physical behavior and interaction of discrete, unbreakable particles, with their own mass and inertia, under the influence of e.g. gravity and boundary conditions such as moving walls. By discretizing time into small time steps ($\Delta t \approx 10^{-8} \si{\second}$), explicit integration of Newton's second law of motion is used to predict the new position and kinematic values for each particle from the previous sums of forces. This Lagrangian approach is ideal for simulating discontinuous materials, such as granularities. The complexity of the computations is kept low by representing the particles as spheres, which keeps contact-searching algorithms simple.
