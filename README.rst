About this branch
-----------------
The git branch ``ns-cfd`` is a work in progress on implementing a Newtonian
fluid, fully coupled to the particle dynamics, by the Navier Stokes formulation
of computational fluid dynamics. The merge into the main branch is planned to
mark the 1.0 release of ``sphere``.

Important release notes
-----------------------
2013-03-13: Sphere has been updated to work with CUDA 5.0 or newer *only*.

2014-01-20: Version fingerprints have been added to the input/output binary
files, and causes old files to be incompatible with either ``sphere`` or
``sphere.py``.

2014-01-25: The description of the installation procedure is moved to the
general documentation.

2014-03-09: The main sphere class (formerly ``spherebin``) has been renamed to
``sim``.

Documentation
-------------
See the separate documentation for general reference and installation
instructions. The documentation is by default available in
the `html <doc/html/index.html>`_ and `pdf <doc/pdf/sphere.pdf>`_ formats.
