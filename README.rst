SPHERE readme
=============
Sphere is a 3D discrete element method algorithm utilizing CUDA.

Sphere is licensed under the GNU General Public License, v.3.
See license.txt for more information.

See the ``doc/`` folder for general reference, by default available in the `html 
<file:./doc/html/index.html>` and `pdf <file:./doc/pdf/sphere.pdf>` formats.

Requirements
------------
The build requirements are:
  * A Nvidia CUDA-supported version of Linux or Mac OS X (see the `CUDA toolkit 
    release notes <http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html>`_ 
    for more information)
  * `CMake <http://cmake.org>`_, version 2.8 or higher
  * A C/C++ compiler toolkit, e.g. the `GNU Compiler Collection 
    <http://gcc.gnu.org/>`_ (GCC)
  * The `Nvidia CUDA toolkit and SDK <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`_

The runtime requirements are:
  * A `CUDA-enabled GPU <http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_gpus.html>`_ 
    with compute capability 1.1 or greater.
  * A Nvidia CUDA-enabled GPU and device driver

Optional tools, required for simulation setup and data processing:
  * `Python 2.7 <http://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.7/>`_
  * `Numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_
  * `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`_
  * `Imagemagick <http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php>`_
  * `ffmpeg <http://ffmpeg.org/>`_

Optional tools, required for building the documentation:
  * `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_
  * `Doxygen <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>`_
  * `Breathe <http://michaeljones.github.com/breathe/>`_

Obtaining sphere
----------------
The best way to keep up to date with subsequent updates, bugfixes and 
development, is to use the Git version control system. To obtain a local 
copy, execute::
 git clone https://github.com/anders-dc/sphere.git

Build instructions
------------------
Sphere is built using `cmake`, the platform-specific c/c++ compilers,
and `nvcc` from the cuda toolkit. Execute the following commands from
the root directory::
 cmake . && make

In some cases the CMake FindCUDA module will have troubles locating the
CUDA SDK directory, and will complain about `cutil_math.h` not being found.

In that case, modify the ``NVSDKCOMPUTE_ROOT`` environment variable in 
`INSTALL.sh`, and execute it.

After a successfull installation, the `sphere` executable will be located
in the root folder. To make sure that all components are working correctly,
execute::
 make test

Updating sphere
---------------
To update your local version, type the following commands in the sphere root 
directory::
 git pull && cmake . && make
